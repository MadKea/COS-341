1. The minDFA will be outputted in the minDFA.xml file.
2. I have included dead states as all transitions are needed in a DFA, (cos210), and to avoid assumptions. I was not sure whether not to as the specs did not specify so I think I am safe.
3. !!!! Since the epsilon symbol was troublesome, I have used '<' as a substitute. So a a|< input is valid.

5. Linux: run the program with ./prac1.out

6. The minDFA.xml does not show start nor accepting states just like the specifications but the object - node- has the member variables.
7. No imports were used.
