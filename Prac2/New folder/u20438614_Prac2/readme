Practical 2

1.I have included both .out and .exe executables in the submission. I'm sorry if .exe does not work. I had a friend my a .exe for me but I couldn't reach him after the Sunday edits so I'm on my own and cannot test it on my side. But I followed your instructions. THE CODE WORKS.
2.You will be asked to input the name of the text file. Include the .txt.
3.The parse tree will be in the parseTree.xml file. (You might have issues with viewing the < and > symbols under CMPR. I did not. So just keep that in mind).
4.Errors will be in the parseTree.xml file instead of a tree.
