Practical 3

Chosen input: program code. Will be using OWN practical 2 parsing.

Once the program is run you will be prompted to input the name of the program file. Please include the extension (.txt).

The parsetree is within the parseTree.xml file and the symbol table is within the table.html file.

If errors or naming convention errors are present no symbol table will be displayed as specified. However, warnings will be displayed alongside the symbol table.

Best regards.
