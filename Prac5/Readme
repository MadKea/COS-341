Practical 5

Chosen input: program code (text file). Will be using OWN practical 2 parsing.

Once the program is run you will be prompted to input the name of the program file. Please include the extension (.txt).

The parsetree is within the parseTree.xml file and the symbol table is within the table.html file.

The BASIC code generated is wihing the basic.txt file.

!!!!The errors detected are still in their respective files (sparseTree.xml and table.html) and have not been transfered to the basic code as it wasn't part of the spec. So if for example a call is made out of its scope, the error is detected in the table.html but basic code is still generated. [If sementic errors are needed just uncomment the code in trans.cpp lines 18-29]

If errors or naming convention errors are present no symbol table will be displayed as specified. However, warnings will be displayed alongside the symbol table.

Semantic errors will be displayed if present alongside the symbol table.

Best regards.
